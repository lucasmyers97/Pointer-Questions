This file stores the user strings contiguously in memory (in the same way as ex26_1). However, an array of pointers is used to store the locations of the strings. Additionally, a pointer to that array of pointers is declared so that it can be passed into the read_in_search function. This allows us to access the stored chars as strings, so we only have to use one for loop when printing them out. 
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "dbg.h"

#define MAX_DATA 100
#define MAX_STRINGS 10

/* 
	read_in_search reads in user input. 
	
	-The user input is a set of strings separated
	by spaces.
	
	-Each char of this input is placed contiguously
	in memory (to_search), with each set of chars (forming a string)
	separated by a null byte.
	
	-Additionally, each pointer in an array of pointers is given the
	location of the beginning of each string.
